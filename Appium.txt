What is appium?
Appium is an open source Mobile automation tool for testing native apps (android and iOS) and mobile browser.
Appium internally uses WebDriver JSON wire (Which Selenium does) to test the apps. So it is just like selenium but for mobile.

Appium Features:
- Open source mobile automation tool.
- The only cross platform supporting tool
- Works for nativ, hybrid and mobile web apps
- Supports Web Driver API - Selenium Family

Supported platforms:
- Android
- iOS
- Firefox OS

- We can write code in any language supported by WebDriver: JAVA, C#, Ruby, Python, JavaScript.

Appium Internal Architecture:

Appium Client Code

         ||                   ||
         \/                  \/
UIAutomator2       XCUITest
Android                 iOS

Appium Client Code -> This is where we write the code
Appium Server -> IS heart of the architecture. This server will listen to Client code
JSON -> When we send our code appium wrap our code and convert it into JSON and send it to the server (For all the language)
And server redirect those actions to mobile, collect those response and send it back to the editor.
UIAutomator2 is provided by Android to test android apps and XCUITest is provided by iOS to test iOS apps.
